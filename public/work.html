                    <p>This is one of the first project I made using HTML and CSS.</p>
                    <p>The goal of this project was to learn more about the flexbox proprety as I was starting to learn
                        CSS
                        and
                        I've read it was a very useful tool to master</p>
                    <p>I struggled a lot between the align items and the justify content proprety. For me the difference
                        between
                        the X and Y axis was really hard tu get. I was stuck until I found <a
                            href="https://flexboxfroggy.com/">Flexbox Froggy</a> It help
                        me visualize what I was doing</p>

                    <p>This project was the first one I made including some Javascript in my HTML and CSS.</p>
                    <p>I didn't focus much on the CSS part because the point was to understand the DOM and how to select
                        an
                        element from my HTML file into my Javascript file</p>
                    <p>It was fun to try the different option the "addEventListener" was offering. But I did struggle A
                        bit
                        with
                        the "creatElement". I had to watch soe tutorials and read more documentation to really get it

                    <p>It was part of a course I took. it was very fun comparing the solutions with the others
                        student
                        because
                        it all looked different but a bit the same. </p>
                    <p>I enjoyed trying this new framework and trying the differents options there was. And even
                        after
                        choosing
                        what I needed from bootrsap I tried to restyle it my way. </p>

                        <p>But it became pretty fun one I got the hang of it. I didn't spend time on the CSS of this

                        <p>I mostly tried to do it by myself and watched the video only when I got stucked. It took me
                            quite a long time to finish. I spend long hours debugging. But I learned so much.</p>
