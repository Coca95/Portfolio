                <p> <span> My name is Coralie.</span>
                    <span>I'm a junior fullstack developper eager to build new
                        projects and learn
                        more
                        about
                        web devlopment.</span>
                    <span> I started my learning journey in 2021.</span> <span>At first I was just curious about
                        programming
                        languages and
                        started reading about it. </span>
                    <span>Then I found myslef trying some stuff and the next thing I
                        know, I'm
                        enrolling somes courses and building web applications.</span>

            <div class="text">
                <p><span>After High School I studied law for three years in Belgium. Then I took a huge turn in my life
                        and traveled around the globe. </span>
                    <span>During my travels I became a Scuba diving instructor. Teaching diving taught me a lot about
                        team spirit and also my own abilities to adapt to an unknown situation. Which is something I
                        found as well in web development. I enjoy to challenge myself and learn new stuff.</span>
                    <span>To learn programming I enrolled in different online classes on OpenClassroom, codeacademy and
                        Udemy where I found the most complete courses. I'm already starting new ones! </span>
                    <span>When I'm not coding I enjoy all sorts of outdoor activity such as divng, snorkeling,
                        paddelboarding, hiking, camping. But also skiing an snowboarding.</span>
                    <span>I'm a very enthusiastic, jolly and friendly person. Always learning from my mistakes. </span>
